# password-generator
No more need to remember all of your password , you can generate all of they in my programm.
In my program you can generate passwords.
In first line write the length of password,
In second you write your personal key (come up with yourself),
In third you write the link on the site or name of program for which you need password.
This programm generates same passwords if you insert same keys and links,that means that you can always get your password.
